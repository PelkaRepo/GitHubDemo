/**
 * This is designed to be a simple test of the capabilities of a local GitHub repository.
 * The actual code to be built will do mostly nothing useful, but will be rather a
 * proof of concept of a working repository system.
 * 
 * This package holds artifacts required for running the main thread, including the
 * main class.
